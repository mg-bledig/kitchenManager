# kitchenManager

Written by MG Bledig

This is a small program that keeps track of time of cooking in the kitchen, or anything you want to keep track time of. The idea is to have more than 1 timer to help keep track of more than one thing at once. Yes, I know there are malty timers out there, but not many that I have found that work well with accessibility programs such as screen readers like NVDA

The program must have as many timers as one might need, as well as each timer identifying what the timer is keeping track of

This program is still very much under development and is still in the first phase. So still early days.

Why use Visual basic.net? Because visual basic is still a very powerful programming language as far as I’m concerned. It gets the job done for now, so why not.

As time goes on, I will update the readme to include the other features of the app I’m hoping to add in.
